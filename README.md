# NEXT-REDUX-TOOLKIT

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to give a try using "The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development". Well, it took several days of very focused thinking, doc research and testing to figure this out. I think it is close to correct but not sure. Redux Toolkit has a lot of pieces to solve and put together, especially with TS. I do believe I have the hang of when and how to use dispatching.

More on the way. I am not using `redux-persist` and will remove it from my other projects.
